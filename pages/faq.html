              We do not have a specific deadline to apply, and we accept
              applications throughout the year. This means that you can apply
              at any time that is convenient for you.

              What are the eligibility criteria for applying?
            </summary>
            <p class="faq-content">
              To apply, one must be a college student and have a startup idea.
              This is the fundamental criterion by which we evaluate
              applications. However, it's worth noting that the idea does not
              need to be fully formed, it can be in the ideation stage as
              well.

              What's the selection ratio for the application?
            </summary>
            <p class="faq-content">
              Our selection ratio is quite high, meaning that if we see that
              all the ideas have potential, we are ready to fund all of them.
              We believe in the power of good ideas, and we want to support as
              many of them as possible.

              Yes, you can still apply even if you are in the ideation stage
              and don't have a product yet. We understand that not every idea
              is fully formed at the time of application and that's okay. We
              are here to support you and help you bring your idea to life.

            <p class="faq-content">
              As a platform, we take 1 percent equity on getting you connected
              with an investor and helping you getting the funding secured.
              This is our way of making sure that we have a vested interest in
              the success of your startup.

              any cohort fees?
            </summary>
            <p class="faq-content">
              The cohort program is offered 2-3 times per year and is
              completely free to participants. All the selected applications
              are part of the cohort. We believe that providing free resources
              and support is the best way to help founders succeed.

              </summary>
            <p class="faq-content">
              No, having no background in running a business will not affect
              your application for shortlisting. We believe that the passion
              and drive to start a business are more important than any degree
              or business background. Every application is treated equally,
              and we take all factors into consideration when evaluatingÂ them.
